# Portfolio Project

Hi! This is my first-try portfolio webpage source code.

I started this self-made project after watching, learning and practicing a lot of frontend coding from Youtube and Udemy in the last year. This project only contains code that I'm fully familiar with, so it can show off my current skills in HTML and CSS, maybe a bit of Javascript, and jQuery. I decided to not use npm and locale packages, because of the small size of the project.

As of the end of February, I think I will start the whole styling process from the start in a different repo. I really wanted to implement some Win XP style, but I think I kinda failed because I have so much more ideas to implement, which does not fit into this vintage style. I will do some mobile responsive design fixes and leave the project as it is.

Project starting date: 2023. Jan. 09.

Current state: Mobile responsive layout customizing
