# Portfolio Project

Hi! This is my portfolio webpage source code.

I started this self-made project after watching, learning and practicing a lot of frontend coding from Youtube and Udemy in the last year. This project only contains code that I'm fully familiar with, so it can show off my current skills in HTML and CSS (with Bootstrap), maybe a bit of Javascript, and jQuery. I won't use npm and locale packages, so if anyone would like to try to run the project with live-server, internet connection is needed because of the CDNs.

Project starting date: 2023. Jan. 09.

Current state: Implementing some CSS transitions, working with dates, updating content
