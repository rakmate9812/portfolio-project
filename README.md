# Portfolio Project

Hi! This is my portfolio webpage source code.

I started this self-made project after watching, learning and practicing a lot of frontend coding from Youtube and Udemy in the last year. This project only contains code that I'm fully familiar with, so it can show off my current skills in HTML and CSS (with Bootstrap), maybe a bit of plain Javascript.

Project starting date: 2023. Jan. 09.
